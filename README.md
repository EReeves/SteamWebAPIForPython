Steam Web API for Python

A quick and dirty python module I wrote for somethin. I wrote this with Python Dev 3.4, so the compatability sucks.

It's really bad, don't use it unless you're crazy.

---------------

Valve API docs:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API

The naming for all of the functions is the same as in the Valve API docs.


Doesn't have support for IEconService(Steam Trading).
