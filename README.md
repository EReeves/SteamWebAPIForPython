Steam Web API for Python

A quick and dirty python module that wraps the Steam Web API so you don't have to worry about http requests and json decryption. I wrote this with Python Dev 3.4, so the compatability sucks.

See another module that seems to do the same thing and what looks like more: https://github.com/pmrowla/steam-condenser-python

---------------

Information regarding the functions in this module can be found in the Valve API docs:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API

The naming for all of the functions is the same as in the Valve API docs.


Doesn't have support for IEconService(Steam Trading).
