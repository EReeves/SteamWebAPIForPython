Steam Web API for Python OUTDATED

A quick and very dirty python module I wrote for something. I wrote this with Python Dev 3.4.

---------------

Valve API docs:
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API

The naming for all of the functions is the same as in the Valve API docs.


Doesn't have support for IEconService(Steam Trading).
